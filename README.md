# Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting Parkinson's Disease based on medical images. The code includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for dataset loading, training the model, and displaying test results.
